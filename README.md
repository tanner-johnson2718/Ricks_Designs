A catch all for all 3d Printing projects until I find a better place to put this. Less of an active repo and more of a storage bank for STL and 3d printing projects

# Macros
## Adding custom Macros in FreeCad
* In Macro/Macros set path to user python scripts
* Add it to tool bar [link](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Customize_Toolbars)
* See [macros](Macros) for examples on how to automate 3D modeling in FreeCAD.
    * `hexagon_tile.py` contains script for tiling hexagons on face, respecting boundaries, and parameterizing number of rows and columns.
