See Boat model for graphics. Width of boat, from outer rim, taken every 6
inches or 152.4 mm. Below is the output of python. The measurments in inches
were converted into mm, and then using the 154.2 mm delta the widths were then
converted into an approximation of the angle that the boat curves every 6 
inches.

| Object | Description |
| --- | ---|
| a | Measurement in inches |
| b | Measurement in mm |
| d | The difference in mm between each measurment |
| delta | Distance in mm between each measurement |
| angles | The angle between each measurement |
