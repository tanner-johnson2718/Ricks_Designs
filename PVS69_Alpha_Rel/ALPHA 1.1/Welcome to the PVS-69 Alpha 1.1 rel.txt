Welcome to the PVS-69 Alpha 1.1 release!


This pack contains the files for the 69 Alpha Bino and Mono and battery pack


YOU DO NOT NEED TO OPEN THE ZIP FILES! 


I get an email about that like every day. you just upload the zip files to OSHPARK, JLCPCB or PCBWAY.



in each file, there is a readme. READ THEM

Due to recent intellectual property violations, I will no longer distribute step files.
