Welcome to the beta release of the PVS-69 ALPHA. 

Due to the extensive R&D time and costs that went into this project, I felt a paid prerelease was necessary.


The public release will be February 15th and the files will become free. 

PVS-69 ALPHA is the 4th generation night vision housing in the 69 lineup. 

ALPHA features a lightweight yet durable housing with an assembly cost of around $100



ALPHA is intended to be an analog/digital housing. depending on your budget you can build it either way. 

ALPHA accepts MX-10160 format tubes or the MX-69 Digital image intensifier tube (DIIT).

**3.3v stepdown buck

2x PVS-14 eye piece. these can get rather expensive but the Chinese ones on alibaba work fine

2x objective lenses. if youre using analog you will use PVS-14 lenses. for these, you can also use Chinese lenses. 
the same seller of the eye pieces also sells them but i would recommend not cheaping out on this end as cheap lenses will have less clarity.



For the PCBs, the files are formatted for OSHPARK. https://oshpark.com/

there are 3 zipped files. you only need one of the bridge files however if you choose the regulated file you will need the polulo 3.3v buck.

The boards are extremely cheap however I do suggest the swift service as it's only a few dollars more and saves a lot of time. 


for printed parts you will need 

1x bridge

1x front plate

1x dovetail 

1x left pod

1x right pod

2x PVS-14 eye piece bodies

**2x 69 adjustment rings (you can use the PVS-14 adjustment rings)

2x lock rings

*2x D rings (optionally you can use the ones that accept M3 grub screws)

**2X C rings (the C clips from the PVS-14 lens work better)

1x TPU Button

a build guide is coming soon so stay tuned!
